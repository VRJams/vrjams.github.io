# Welcome!
VRJams is a newly born project from a group of UniPD students, to learn about VR and to bring our visions to life.
Our goal is to help students get some hands-on programming experience, develop 3D and VR software, explore the potentials and limitations of these technologies and enter the world of Open Source software.

## How?
To create our programs, we decided to use [LÖVR]({{page.LOVR}}), a great VR framework, easily accessible for beginners and great for prototyping and shaping new ideas, all free and open source. It's also widely cross-platform, supporting Both PCVR headsets like HTC Vive or Oculus Rift, and Android based Headsets like the Quest 2 and Pico 4.

## Do I need a VR headset?
No, a headset is not a requirement. The software runs on a normal laptop perfectly fine, without even much of a need for high performance graphics cards or whatnot. You can interact with the VR environment with keyboard and mouse, although there are some limits to this. At our meetings you might be able to borrow someone's headset to try your code out!

We're also talking with the DEI to get some funds for headsets, but that's a story for another time

## Do I have to be good at programming?

No, while [LÖVR]({{page.LOVR}}) is built in C, it has a complete interface in Lua, a very beginner-friendly language. It's kinda like Python, only much faster thanks to the LuaJIT. 

If you are interested, you can also use OpenGL and GLSL to create graphics code for visual effects or to run computations on the GPU, or even delve into the inner workings of [LÖVR]({{page.LOVR}}) using C. It's all open!

## Unsure?

I'll give you a quick peek at one of our working projects

   </video>
</div>

If you have any quesions, you can join our [Telegram Group]({{page.telegram}}). We also meet reguarly at the DEI, in room Se (ground floor, end of the hallway, right) every Thursday between 16:00 and 18:00.

We'll also be hosing a bigger event for newcomers in March/April, stay tuned for more info!
